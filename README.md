# Java-Projects
Some java Projects that I have finished

# The Projects Include:

 Airline Rewards application using java which calculated user specific data from a database file containing flight data for a year. The application was able to allocate various different tiers to passengers depending on the data given. Application functionality was divided into 5 different classes representing different Airline tiers and their distinguishable characteristics, and a passenger class that contained user-specific data. A custom generic Map was used in order to keep data consistent for every passenger and adequate for time constraint. 

 
 ArrayNumSet application that turned an otherwise static array, into a functioning Hash Set. The ArrayNumSet effectively used the Linked List chaining method in order to avoid hashing collisions.
